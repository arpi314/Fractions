# Fractions

I used structures and dynamic memory allocation in C to perform the following operations on two manually inputted fractions from the user.


1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Simplification


All details of functions used are in the code itself. Just check that out, I'm too lazy. Thanks ;D
